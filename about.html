            Our lead folder is a member of the <a href="http://www.britishorigami.info">British Origami Society</a> , one of the largest Origami organisations around for over 50 years. We also host workshops as part of the active and popular SOAS
            Origami Society which has been going strong for over 50 years. Currently we don't charge for our workshops but ask our clients to provide us with materials and travel reimbursement (more detail provided upon contact).
